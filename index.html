         	<p>As a diagnosed level 1 adult &amp; parent of a level 2 child, I did some actual research (you should try it sometime) and all the hate Autism Speaks receives is mostly from &ldquo;self-diagnosed&rdquo; nitwits or neurotypicals jumping on a meme&rsquo;d bandwagon to seem woke. I support their mission.</p>

         	<p>Some people seem to love being angry for the sake of being angry and will seek out any little thing about which to be offended, irritated, or enraged.  Not everything encountered during the course of the day is worthy of the energy required for indignation or fury.</p>

         	<p>After being off for spring break the past week, Mac resumes his normal therapy schedule today.  I think we&rsquo;ve both been going a bit more stir crazy than normal so getting back to schedule will be good for both of us.  It&rsquo;s also sunny out so the kids will get playground time.</p>

         	<p>Spent the better part of my day basically rebuilding my blog theme from scratch.  I&rsquo;m not sure why I decided to take on that project but it was definitely a learning experience. I&rsquo;m now all &ldquo;tinkered out&rdquo; for the day.</p>

         	<p>So glad the weather is starting to get more conducive to outdoor activities. Looking forward to some consistency in temperatures &amp; sunshine soon. I still don&rsquo;t feel safe doing indoor things but outside there&rsquo;s plenty of room for aerosol dissipation therefore safer to go and do.</p>

         	<p>Have been re-watching <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80057918">@LuciferNetflix</a> from S1E1 this week in anticipation of the new episodes coming out in May.  I love this show. Excited for new eposides but sad they&rsquo;ll probably be the last. Hope they end the series well if it&rsquo;s the series finale. ðŸ“º</p>

         	<p>It was a bit cumbersome doing it over video conference, but Mac had his reevaluation and updated diagnosis this afternoon with the neuropsychologist to confirm he is still ASD and is still in need of certain therapies and services. Been over a year since I started trying to get this appointment. His reports will be available in a week or so and then we can begin re-setting up some of his services that have lasped due to both the pandemic and his outdated previous evaluation. Thankfully his main program of speech and OT isn&rsquo;t dependent on this evaluation and has continued in-clinic sessions throughout the pandemic so he has been able to stay consistent with those therapies.</p>

         	<p>I usually have the taxes done by the end of February but due to events the past several months I&rsquo;m behind on life in general. My husband took Mac with him to install his stepmother&rsquo;s new microwave so I completed and submitted our taxes today. Now I have one less thing. âœ”</p>

         	<p>Yesterday my family&rsquo;s favorite feline companion crossed the rainbow bridge quite suddenly and unexpectedly adding to the grief already being suffered by my mother and daughter.</p>

<p>In the past 8 months, my husband&rsquo;s grandfather passed away, my husband was shot and watched his mother murdered in front of him by his cousin, his mother succumbed to her injuries on his birthday in November, shortly thereafter our marriage completely imploded.  After a few months we were able to rebuild and are doing well.  The new year came and there was so much hope.  Then my father passed away unexpectedly in February.  Now Minnie joins him.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not even the end of the first quarter and I have already just given up on this year.</p>

         	<p>I think that I need to explore some more and/or different creative outlets. Iâ€™m not even sure what I do or would enjoy anymore. Is it ok to do something for a bit and then stop and do something different for a bit? I feel creatively ambivalent.</p>
